Rationale

I wanted to create a working dashboard by creating a python app which connected the mongo.db database to a web interface published via Horoku. I wanted to convert and present the third party information (DonorsChoose.org) in a JSON format to display it using D3.js in a related graphical format. A concern was to get all the graphs and dropdowns displaying on a single page as would be used by a production dashboard for ease of visibility for the concerned related graphs.  Also I wanted to display in a simple template which would allow for ease of viewing of the various components without any unneccessary distractions. The added dropdown of donation district to the standard graphs would allow a more drilled down view from Country/State/County/Distrtict of the donations contributed thus giving a more granular view of contributions.
